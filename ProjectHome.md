Some objectives follow, not necessarily integrated into a single tool but small tools that can be used separately or together.  Where other tools already exist to do the same thing there will be instructions and tips for using them here.

Initially to focus on balloon trajectories.

Simulink s-function support, generic udp for live display.
Other connection types for telemetered data?

Matlab mat-file loading, and generic binary and csv file loading.

Flat file specification of vehicle/objects, movable parts.

Light weight low cpu overhead 3D display in Processing (processing.org).

Small gridfloat (or other USGS provided formats) loading into processing.

Google Earth API?

OpenSceneGraph for high end 3D display?
